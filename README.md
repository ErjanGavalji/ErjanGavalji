## Hello, fellow visitor! ðŸ‘‹

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ErjanGavalji)

I'm happy to help if you need assistance. I have a strong background in software development and
DevOps, with a current focus on DevOps practices. My primary areas of expertise include JavaScript,
Docker, Kubernetes, and shell scripting. I offer my experience in C# as well (though a bit rusty).

Feel free to reach out at erjan@anjack.io if you'd like to collaborate or need some
advice. Iâ€™m always open to discussing tech, contributing to projects, or simply sharing ideas.
