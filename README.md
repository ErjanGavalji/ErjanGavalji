## Hello, fellow visitor! ðŸ‘‹

Here's a cheeky profile counter:

On a more serious note, I'm happy to help if you need assistance. I have a strong background
in software development and DevOps, with a current focus on DevOps practices. My primary areas
of expertise include JavaScript, Docker, Kubernetes, and shell scripting. I also have experience
in C# and VB.NET (though a bit rusty) and can write SQL scripts that wonâ€™t break your
server â€” well, no promises! ðŸ˜‰

Feel free to reach out at erjan@anjack.io if you'd like to collaborate or need some
advice. Iâ€™m always open to discussing tech, contributing to projects, or simply sharing ideas.
